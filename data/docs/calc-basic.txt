The design of a pad footing is concerned initially with the determination of suitable footing dimensions to ensure that under serviceability conditions so that excessive ground bearing pressures are not developed.
Once a suitable base size has been calculated the base can be designed for bending, shear and punching shear at ultimate load conditions. 

This program calculates the minimum dimensions of a square or rectangular pad footing supporting a centrally placed square column.
The column can be subjected to axial load and/or moment about one axis, and different combinations of dead, live and wind loading may be considered.


6.1.1 Design procedure
(i) Under serviceability conditions
Under the action of axial loads and moments, two possible stress distributions
are possible under the base of the footing.
(a) Base fully in compression
Figure 6.1 shows the assumed stress distribution under the rectangular
base, shown with the moment, M, acting about the X axis and the axial load,
N, acting through the centroid. The axial load will include the self-weight of
the base.
If the allowable bearing pressure at the most highly compressed face is Ia,
then the stress condition at this face is given by

Hence, to satisfy equation (6.1) suitable values of Lx and Ly must be
determined.
